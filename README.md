# Midterm Progress

This is where I'm at for Midterm. Although I'm not as far as I'd like to be, I am very proud of my work so far. I am working alone on this project so balancing everything has been a brand new experience.

# Usage
To use this website:

1. Clone repo to your remote device

2. DO NOT push your work to the main branch! Create a new branch name that makes sense, make changes to improve the site, push your BRANCH back to the repo.

3. Wait for confirmation of merge!

Thank you so much for the interest in my project!
